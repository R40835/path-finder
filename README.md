# path-finder
This project is an implementation of the A* algorithm by extending an existing codebase that already includes the Dijkstra's algorithm. The A* algorithm incorporates additional functionalities by calculating heuristic values and updating cost calculations to allow for more efficient pathfinding and improved search performance.

# Heuristic Distances Implemented
Once you've launched the program:
- Press 'A' for: Manhatan Distance.
- Press 'B' for: Euclidean Distance.
- Press 'C' for: Diagonal Distance.
